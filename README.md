- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HawkWoods. I am currently a Parking Planner / Project manager for a consulting firm. I am teaching myself (with all the on-line tutorials) how to use QGIS and QField to use for work projects.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to use Qfield better. Specifically, I would like to learn how to add 1:n photos to project.
